        <h1>A Journey Of The Heart</h1>
        <p>A heart is something you cannot hold,</p>
        <p>It must be earned, or so I've been told.</p>
        <p>A heart feels love in many ways.</p>
        <p>Once it's earned, it's there all your days.</p>
        <p>Your love is pure so protect it,</p>
        <p>But never let it go stale,</p>
        <p>For once you find a little love,</p>
        <p>THe ship in your heart will set sail.</p>
        <p>The journey may be long and hard,</p>
        <p>But know this fact is true,</p>
        <p>You are a wonderful person,</p>
        <p>And there's always someone cheering for you.</p>
        <p>No matter the distance between,</p>
        <p>No matter how far you roam,</p>
        <p>We all will be here rooting for you,</p>
        <p>The second you make it home.</p>
        <p>Love is not just family,</p>
        <p>It also applies to friends.</p>
        <p>So when you think of those who love you,</p>
        <p>Know that my love has no end.</p>
        <p>The story is your heart is unique,</p>
        <p>In it's own special, beautiful way.</p>
        <p>So take good care and dream big,</p>
        <p>Because we'll love you all your days.</p>
