        <h1>A Star In My Hand</h1>
        <p>Most people say, you can't hold a star,</p>
        <p>The heavens are out of reach, and extremely far.</p>
        <p>I say a star doesn't</p>
        <p>Have to be from the sky.</p>
        <p>I say it's people,</p>
        <p>Who are extremely kind.</p>
        <p>A star is not found,</p>
        <p>In the heavens alone</p>
        <p>A star can be found,</p>
        <p>Wherever you roam.</p>
        <p>The stars that I love are the ones who stay true</p>
        <p>All of these stars can be described as all you!</p>
        <p>The stars that I see here,</p>
        <p>Are wonderfully kind.</p>
        <p>Generous, caring,</p>
        <p>The best that I'll find.</p>
        <p>So the stars within reach,</p>
        <p>Are the people I know,</p>
        <p>The stars in my hands,</p>
        <p>Their personalities glow!</p>
        <h2>A little about this poem</h2>
        <p>This poem is for all the people who don't believe they are wonderful. I'm here to tell you that no matter what other people say, no matter what you think, you are most certainly a star!</p>
