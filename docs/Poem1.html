        <h1>Silver Lining</h1>
        <p>
            Some clouds are grey,
        </p>
        <p>Some clouds are white,</p>
        <p>But the one I'd rather be on,</p>
        <p>Is the one that's silver lined.</p>
        <p>A grey cloud is dark and sad,</p>
        <p>And clouds like that make people feel bad.</p>
        <p>A white cloud is happy and pure,</p>
        <p>But joy alone is not a good cure.</p>
        <p>So some clouds are grey,</p>
        <p>And some clouds are white,</p>
        <p>But the one that I'll choose every time,</p>
        <p>Is the one that's silver lined.</p>
        <h3>A little about this poem
        </h3>
        <p>The inspiration for this poem comes from the fact that, even though life inevitably can become dark, like that grey cloud, we can always choose to have a brighter outlook. But as a good friend once told me, there is such a thing as toxic joy. This joy becomes such a distraction from pain, that it can become unhealthy. We try to cover the pain that is still there. We must acknowledge this pain to truly deal with it, but we should never let it consume us. So I encourage you, pick the silver lined cloud. You will always have a little bit of darkness in your life, but take a peek behind the cloud, and you'll always find some light.</p>
